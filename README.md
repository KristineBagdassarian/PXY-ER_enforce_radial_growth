# PXY-ER_enforce_radial_growth
Code used for 'Organ-specific genetic interactions between paralogues of the PXY and ER receptor kinases enforce radial patterning in Arabidopsis vascular tissue'
The zip file contains 3 items.
Note that for the code to work, images are needed with the correct colour code (imagesNew is the function where you can change the 
colour-code to match what you want).
You also need to use a valid folder address where the images would be stored and valid names of files and items such as cell types and
genotype names.
The folder 'Diameter' simply analyses some ready-made data of radii of a few plants.
The folder 'Tables with all data together' combines all the data of all the images in a table. 
The folder 'Data split by plant and random selection for ANOVA' simply stores the data extracted from each individual plant
in a separate row so you can rearrange them after that and use nested ANOVA.
